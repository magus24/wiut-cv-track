solution.py — the ONLY file a team has to implement.

    detect_events(video_path)  -> [[start_sec, end_sec, label], ...]    # Part A
    RiskEstimator().reset(meta); .step(frame, t_sec) -> float           # Part B (optional)

Keep the names and signatures exactly as they are. Everything else — models,
tracking, rules, helper modules under src/ — is up to you.

Labels must come from CLASSES. You may REMOVE classes you never predict;
do not add new ids.
